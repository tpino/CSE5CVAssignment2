Purpose
This assessment mirrors real-world computer vision workflows used in industries such as security, transport and entertainment, where video processing, object tracking and facial recognition are essential for developing intelligent, responsive systems.

Task details
This individual assessment aims to consolidate your knowledge base and practical skills to process video and develop object detection and face detection applications. By completing the assessment, you will have a computer vision system which can track and recognise moving objects and human faces.

This assessment has four main tasks. In Task 1, you must collect a video. In Task 2, you must use a pre-trained CNN model to recognise and track all the objects that appear in your video. In Task 3, you must implement a facial detection solution and apply it to your video. In Task 4, you must respond to questions and write a report.

You must submit your code, produced videos and report for marking.

Instructions
Task 1: Data collection
Collect a short video (15–20 seconds) using your own camera or mobile phone.

Please note the following requirements for Task 1:

There must be at least five MS COCO categories present in the video. Please consult the list of MS COCO class names. Here’s a short list of things you may have at home that are likely to be detected: cup, birds, chair, mouse and clock, along with many more options. There are 91 different classes in MS COCO.
The video must have some moving objects or be panning for at least a few seconds. Note: Try to keep the video relatively steady with smooth, slow transitions to assist with tracking.
You must be present in the video and face the camera for at least a few seconds. You may pull a funny face if you’d like.
You will need to submit the video as part of the assessment. The video will only be accessible by subject teaching staff for the purposes of marking the assessment.
Audio is not required.
To evaluate the object recognition and face detection results in Task 4, you need to prepare ‘ground truth’.
Submit a video named ‘task1.mp4’ (or ‘task1.mkv’, or any other video format).
Task 2: Object tracking and recognition
Use the pre-trained CNN models you have learnt in this subject to detect, recognise and track the moving objects in your video.

Please note the following requirements for Task 2:

Get detections and recognition results for each frame.
Choose either IoU or box centre distance as the association method.
Create and submit a video named ‘task2.mp4’ that displays your results overlaid on ‘task1.mp4’.

Task 3: Face detection
Create a facial detection model that can detect and track faces in your video.

Please note the following requirements for Task 3:

Use at least three different pre-trained Haar classifiers.
Perform face detection for each frame and display the result above the face in the video.
Create and submit a video named ‘task3.mp4’ that displays your face detection and recognition results overlaid on ‘task2.mp4’.

Task 4: Discussion
Evaluate Task 2 and Task 3 results using appropriate evaluation measures.
Analyse your object and face detection, recognition and tracking results, and answer the following questions.
Is your model able to detect and track all the objects and faces in the video? Why or why not? What are the challenging issues leading to the initial unsatisfactory results?
What have you done to improve the results?
Are there any other findings or investigations you want to tell us?
Submit a report containing answers to Task 4.

Assessment criteria
This assessment will measure your ability to:

process image/video datasets for computer vision tasks (10%)
use computer vision models for image recognition (40%)
evaluate, interpret and improve recognition results (50%).
Refer to the marking guide for marking and feedback information.

Submission details
Report, code and data submission:

Upload a zip file to the LMS before the due date.
The zip file must contain your report, code, the produced videos and images. Your code should be neat and readable.
In keeping with La Trobe University policy, all assignments are to be submitted in Moodle via Turnitin.

To be accepted, your assessment submission must generate a similarity score (you are responsible for checking this). Submitting in Word or PDF format is the best way to do this. If your submission does not generate a similarity score, it cannot be checked for plagiarism and therefore will not be marked.
